                            Hand sketches, as well as physical modelling, has become an integral part of the early
                            design
                            process. From city-scale massing to fine detail, both techniques allow for quick multiple
                            tests
                            of 2D and 3D views. Guildhall library model created an opportunity to recreate a detailed
                            facade
                            with plaster and MDF board while investigating the construction process.

                            International idea competition involved the submission of a proposal of the monastery for
                            Sao
                            Domingos da Batalha Fortress in Portugal. Challenging terrain, remaining ruins and spiritual
                            characteristics of the project become crucial for the final design. Building refers to
                            classical
                            art examples in abstract architectural forms. The relative positioning of the rooms results
                            in a
                            hierarchical relationship between them (a reference to the Temple of Khonsu at Karnak).
                            Rejection of the physical outside form of the project refers to the act of joining the
                            community. Stairs leading down the building symbolises a spiritual journey of one's internal
                            transformation.

                            Positioning of the rooms allows creating two large openings for natural light with the view
                            of
                            the sea. The uncommon shape of the room is created by the surfaces of two large spheres in
                            near
                            proximity which appears to almost touch each other. This concept refers to Michelangelo's
                            'The
                            creation of Adam'. Chipping retrieved from the carving is used as interior material which
                            naturally blends with surroundings.
