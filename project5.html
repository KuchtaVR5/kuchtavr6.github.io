                        The site for the project is located next to St James's Church in London. The main principle of
                        the design was to combine a single gallery space open to the public with a private house for the
                        art owner.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text op hide" id="2">
                        The Interior of the art gallery was carefully designed to accommodate a specific in its
                        experience digital art. The proposal has explored two strongly contrasting spaces connected by a
                        long narrow tunnel. From a standard room, which serves as a sitting area, visitors can enter
                        tall dark space where digital art is exhibited. The screen positioned away from the back wall
                        gives an illusion of deep darkness which makes it difficult to notice walls around it. The
                        screen illuminates the room and peeks in through the tunnel to the sitting area.
                    </p>

                        The project's plan mirrors the layout of the church opposite. It creates a similar flow of
                        people in the public art gallery and divides the yard into a more quiet enclosed park and a busy
                        market with an entrance to the high street. On the first floor narrow balcony in the office area
                        was placed in order to connect the art gallery connects with the rest of the house. It also
                        demonstrates the importance of double-height spaces which provide multiple viewpoints.

                        The use of glass blocks panels as walls for the residential part of the building gives privacy
                        and at the same time allows for a lot of daylight. However, at night it creates an impression of
                        an illuminating cube. Moreover, the purpose of the spaces is reflected in the chosen materials:
                        the art gallery is made out of dark concrete without windows keeping the space dark inside for
                        film exhibition, whereas the private part of the house is made out of glass blocks forming a
                        delicate looking shape.

                    <p class="text op hide" id="8">
                        The perspective section represents the art gallery tunnel in the middle of the ground floor
                        which is wrapped around by the living spaces. Furthermore, rooms are separated from the outside
                        by the glass blocks cloche.
