                        Proposal for a self-build family house created in duet by Aleksandra Kuchta and Sam Newton. The
                        site for the project is located on Balcorne Street, in London and it is a 6-meter wide elongated
                        site with a tree on each end. The design focuses on the idea of rigorous simplification of the
                        construction process to make it more accessible for the self-builder. The proposal follows the
                        rhythm of existing terraced houses and offers a three-storey house with a similar footprint and
                        aligned with the current street elevation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text op hide" id="7">
                        On the ground floor, you can see services being placed left and two bedrooms on the right,
                        divided with a long corridor which leads straight from the main entrance to the garden. In-built
                        wardrobes along the division wall act as additional structural support and help with
                        sound-proofing. The design includes a reverse floor plan with bedrooms on the ground floor and
                        living on the first floor. Long space provides sunlight from the south and a great view of the
                        garden. Double height in the dining area and large glazing makes it feel spacious. With a
                        sloping ceiling, we imaged the space as an artist studio. The low sill in the kitchen window
                        becomes a perfect spot to sit and enjoy the morning sun. The mezzanine on the top floor designed
                        as a study has access to the roof terrace. The room can be converted into a third bedroom in the
                        future if necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text op hide" id="10">
                        In order to ensure the buildability potential of the proposal double stud wall has been
                        introduced. This solution guarantees continuous insulation and airtightness. It also allows for
                        an easy assembly process as all the elements can be easily erected and installed by three
                        people. The spanning direction of the floor joists on each level as well as roof construction
                        methodology supports the idea of simplified self-build design.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text op hide" id="13">
                        Even though the building is taller compare to the adjacent terraced house it isnâ€™t visible from
                        the street as a balustrade of the balcony in front on the top floor seem to be the highest point
                        of the building. We made sure that the pitched roof fits perfectly within the existing chimney
                        stacks. The balcony provides a view over the roofs of terraced houses. Visible from the side
                        elevation is a solid wall without any windows and enhance the shape of the proposed design.
                        Detailed drawings allow estimating materials cost for the self-build project.
